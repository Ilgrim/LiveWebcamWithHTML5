# Live Stream Using HTML 5 and Node.js #
My experiments with HTML 5 and Node.js to make Live Stream.

## Canvas ##
In this case, I'm geting live video and taking snapshots. And a pooling send a canvas to node.js server via websockets.

This case is fully functional now.

## RTMP ##
... It's not been done yet.
